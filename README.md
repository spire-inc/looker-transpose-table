# looker-transpose-table
For when you need rows to be columns and columns to be rows.

Codebase is intentionally simple and was designed to be a quick solution to a limited problem. Don't expect anything more. IMO, Looker should really just support this natively.

To use this in looker, use jsdelivr CDN. For example:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/spire-inc/looker-transpose-table@0.1/transpose_table.js

Use pyhttps to test. Follow looker's tutorial to see how.
