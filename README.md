# looker-transpose-table
For when you need rows to be columns and columns to be rows.

Codebase is intentionally simple and was designed to be a quick solution to a limited problem. Don't expect anything more. IMO, Looker should really just support this natively.

Release are tagged in the repo.  Link to a tagged release in looker.

Use pyhttps to test. Follow looker's tutorial to see how.
